These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist),"paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V  sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
